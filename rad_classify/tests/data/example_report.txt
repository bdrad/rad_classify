INDICATION:
MR BRAINNAV WITH DTI
CLINICAL HISTORY: Unruptured aneurysm
COMPARISON: CTA brain same date
TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 
tesla.
CONTRAST MEDIA: Intravenous gadolinium chelate was administered for 
post-contrast imaging.
FINDINGS:
Parenchyma:  No mass effect or evidence for hemorrhage.  Minimal scattered 
foci of white matter foci of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity, nonspecific, 
likely related to senescent change.
Vasculature: Mild irregularity of the cavernous and supraclinoid internal 
carotid arteries related to atherosclerosis.
Marrow: Normal marrow signal intensity within the skull base, calvarium 
and facial skeleton.
Visualized orbits:  Unremarkable.
Visualized paranasal sinuses:  Unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. MRI performed for neurosurgical navigation. No acute infarct, 
hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, herniation.
2. Redemonstration of 1.5 cm superiorly directed left cavernous/clinoid 
internal carotid artery aneurysm (fusiform versus wide necked saccular). 
Conventional angiogram is recommended for further evaluation.
3.  Additional inferomedially directed 3 mm aneurysm of the right 
supraclinoid internal carotid artery is also noted, better seen on prior 
CTA.
