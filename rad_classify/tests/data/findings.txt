Parenchyma:  No mass effect or evidence for hemorrhage.  Minimal scattered
foci of white matter foci of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity, nonspecific,
likely related to senescent change.
Vasculature: Mild irregularity of the cavernous and supraclinoid internal
carotid arteries related to atherosclerosis.
Marrow: Normal marrow signal intensity within the skull base, calvarium
and facial skeleton.
Visualized orbits:  Unremarkable.
Visualized paranasal sinuses:  Unremarkable.
